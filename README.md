Implementing a compiler for my own designed programming language; Ive never wrote a compiler before, and Im still Learning and researching.
Also Ive tried this project with other languages before, which also indicates my journey in this field:

Project before this one (also not completed):
<a href="https://github.com/pya-h/fr3E.ks">Same on TypeScript</a>

And the very first project:
<a href="https://github.com/pya-h/freeky">Same on Python3</a>

I've abondand these two, cause I'd like to do this as proper as I can; And those projects didn't satisfy my OCD.
